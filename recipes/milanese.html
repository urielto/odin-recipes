        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick the basil leaves, then finely chop the stalks.</li>
            <li>Heat a splash of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and basil stalks and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden.</li>
            <li>Tip the tinned tomatoes into the pan and squash them down with the back of a spoon. Fill the empty tomato tin with water and pour this in too. Season and simmer for 30 minutes, or until reduced, glossy and thick.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts on a board and cover with a double layer of clingfilm. Bash with a saucepan to flatten them to 5mm thick.</li>
            <li>Tip the flour into one bowl, then crack and beat the eggs in a second bowl. Add the breadcrumbs to a third, finely grate in half of the Parmesan, then shake to combine.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken in the flour, then the egg and finally in the cheesy breadcrumbs, until thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and cook the chicken for 3 to 4 mins on each side, or until golden and the meat is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions, then drain and add to the tomato sauce, loosening with a little of the cooking water if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta alongside the crispy chicken, with the remaining Parmesan and basil leaves scattered over.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
